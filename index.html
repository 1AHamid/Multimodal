        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>This project explores three influential stories—<em>Vagabond</em>, <em>Vinland Saga</em>, and <em>Gurren Lagann</em>—that have profoundly shaped who I am today and who I aspire to become. These narratives are not just tales I enjoy; they resonate deeply within me and compel me to reflect on my own life experiences, challenges, and ambitions.</p>

        <p><em>Vagabond</em> presents a unique perspective on the journey of self-discovery and mastery. Through the life of Miyamoto Musashi, I learned the importance of perseverance, discipline, and the pursuit of excellence. The story challenges me to embrace the struggles in my own life and to view them as opportunities for growth rather than obstacles to my success.</p>

        <p><em>Vinland Saga</em> captivates with its themes of honor, revenge, and the complexities of human relationships. As I followed Thorfinn’s transformation from vengeance to redemption, I found parallels to my own experiences of overcoming anger and frustration. This narrative has inspired me to seek forgiveness and understanding rather than retaliation in my own conflicts.</p>

        <p>Lastly, <em>Gurren Lagann</em> encapsulates the spirit of determination and hope against insurmountable odds. Its vibrant characters and dynamic storytelling remind me that dreams are achievable with the right mindset. I aspire to embody the tenacity and courage exhibited by the characters as I pursue my passions and face the uncertainties of the future.</p>
